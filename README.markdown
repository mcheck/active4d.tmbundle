### Active4D.tmBundle
This is a copy of aparajita's tmbundle for active4D to be used with Sublime Text 2 (or TextMate 1.x)
Aparajita's bundle, if you want to pull the zip, is at: http://www.aparajitaworld.com/files/Active4D/tm.zip
I pushed it here so that I can quickly pull it to various machines worked on.

To use in sublime text 2 (mac only, for others consult the manual at http://docs.sublimetext.info)

```
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User
$ git clone git://github.com/mcheck/active4d.tmbundle.git Active4D.tmbundle
```

No need to restart sublime, it will just start working.  As far as I can tell, anyway.

I also placed the theme file in gist.  It can be moved to the same location:
```
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User
$ git clone git://gist.github.com/4056643.git Active4D.tmTheme
```
